Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is the first challenge developed during the ONE - Oracle Next Education program, with the aim of putting the studied contents into practice.
The challenge is to create a text encoder/decoder using the knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript acquired during the classes.
Cards were made available in Trello to guide and manage the development of the project and a standard model for styling in Figma.

my project
I always try to keep my code as organized as possible, to make it easier to understand and access if something needs to change.

In the HTML structure I modified:
the page icon, title, and description;
the header, where I placed the page link in the logo. Thus, when clicking on the logo, the page is reloaded (I usually do this because I find it an interesting feature);
the "only lower case letters and no accent" warning to appear only if the user types capital or accented letters;
a text area that shows the encoding/decoding result;
I added my name and social media;

Without modifying CSS:
The font for "Montserrat light 300", its size and line spacing;
Background and shadow colors;
The page layout for mobile devices;

Without JavaScript: 
I created the encode, decode, copy and clean functions;
